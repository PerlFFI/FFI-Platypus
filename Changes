  - Improved thread safety by using MY_CXT for some very infrequently used
    global variables.

0.37_02   2015-07-15 16:33:40 -0400

0.37_01   2015-07-15 09:24:53 -0400
  - for cpan testers only

0.37      2015-05-29 14:28:21 -0400
  - Added compatability back in for older version of constant
    (newer one is not available on CPAN yet)

  - Explicitly require constant pragma version 1.32

0.35      2015-05-29 12:06:39 -0400
  - FFI::Platypus::Record uses constant to create size of alignment constants
    instead of creating them with a sub reference (this usage was deprecated
    in Perl 5.22)

0.34      2015-05-07 09:27:04 -0400
  - Require Alien::FFI which is more reliable at configure time on some platforms

0.33      2015-03-23 21:55:02 -0400
  - Additional fix for Microsoft Visual C++ that didn't get folded into
    the previous release.
  - Fixed segfault during global destruction (gh#53)

0.32      2015-03-18 13:02:53 -0400
  - Make sure -L flags from Alien::FFI come before those in perl Config
    For more reliable builds
  - Support for Microsoft Visual C++ (you will probably also need
    Alien::FFI 0.09 or beter)

0.31      2015-02-26 13:41:23 -0500
  - Fix bug involving wide custom arguments 
    "wide" meaning where a single Perl argument is translated
    into multiple machine code arguments.  (pipcet++ gh#43)

0.30      2015-02-25 17:50:54 -0500
  - You can now pass an opaque in place of a closure type (pipcet++ gh#40,gh#41)
  - FFI closures are now cached and can be reused if the same closure is passed
    repeatedly (pipcet++ gh#40,gh#42)
  - Passing non-reference to scalar as a pointer argument will now issue a warning
    (gh#5)

0.29      2015-02-24 08:50:34 -0500
  - Delayed loading of Win32::ErrorMode to avoid build prereq failure on Windows

0.28      2015-02-23 14:01:54 -0500
  - Fix Win32 probe prereq on non-Strawberry 5.20.x+
  - Fix for Solaris cc

0.27      2015-02-22 11:17:05 -0500
  - Interface to alternate ABIs / calling conventions
  - Added abi method
  - Added abis class method
  - Simplify Win32 probe
  - Added FFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32 which provides data types used by
    the Windows API.  Takes care of subtle differences between
    Win32 and Win64.
  - Fixed bugs specific to 5.8.x
  - Language plugins can now specify an ABI with abi class method
  - Default ABI for FFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32 is stdcall on 32bit windows

0.26      2015-02-18 17:47:43 -0500
  - Added support for pointers to longdouble (in C "long double *") type
  - Added support for array of longdouble (in C "long double []") type
  - Added tied array interface for record array members (see FFI::Platypus::Record::TieArray)
    Marked as EXPERIMENTAL
  - Array members of records can now be accessed (set/get) by element
  - Array members of records types are now documented (see FFI::Platypus::Record)
  - Bugfix: array wasn't being updated on return for variable length
    array types
  - Should now build with an Alien::FFI that was built with ALIEN_FORCE=1

0.25      2015-02-16 20:18:41 -0500
  - Probe for proper long double support instead of trusting ffi.h
  - This disables long double support on cygwin, which does not seem to
    work, at least in so far as it seems to work on other platforms
    patches to prove otherwise are welcome.

0.24      2015-02-16 15:38:58 -0500
  - Fixed Windows / Strawberry configuration issues

0.19      2015-02-03 13:34:53 -0500
  - Accept additional extensions, in addition to dlext
    Example: on OS X both .bundle and .dylib can be used
    Example: although arguably wrong, on cygwin sometimes .so is used
  - Added Module::Build::FFI->ffi_dlext class method

0.18      2015-01-30 15:22:07 -0500
  - Improved support for C++ in Module::Build::FFI
  - Module::Build::FFI can now be subclassed to support foreign 
    languages other than C and C++.  See Module::Build::FFI::Rust as an 
    example.
  - Added a hook to allow different names for native types.  See 
    FFI::Platypus::Lang::Rust for an example.
  - Added a hook to allow mangling of symbol (function) names.  See 
    FFI::Platypus::Lang::CPP for an example with C++
  - Module::Build::FFI#ffi_include_dir can now be an array reference
  - Module::Build::FFI#ffi_source_dir can now be an array reference
  - Module::Build::FFI#ffi_libtest_dir can now be an array reference
  - Module::Build::FFI will build assembly source files (with .s
    extensions) in the libtest and ffi directories

0.17      2015-01-28 11:11:02 -0500
  - Allow integer and floating point type default to 0 when not provided
    without warning
  - You can now take the sizeof a custom type (it will be the size of
    the native type that is actually passed on the C argument stack).
  - Sizeof should be faster now as it doesn't look up the other meta
    information or create a hash to contain it
  - Added record type see FFI::Platypus::Type#Records
  - Added bool as a primitive type.

0.16      2015-01-23 17:31:00 -0500

  - Third beta
  - moved cast and sizeof from FFI::Platypus::Memory
    into FFI::Platypus methods.
  - cast and size of functions for FFI::Platypus::Declare
  - attach_cast for faster casting
  - renamed FFI::Platypus::Declare#function to

    goes out of scope (GH#4)
