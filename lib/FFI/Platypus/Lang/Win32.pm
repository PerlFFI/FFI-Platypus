=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the Windows datatypes used by the Windows API.
This means that you can use things like C<DWORD> as an alias for
C<uint32>.  The full list of type aliases is not documented here as
it may change over time or be dynamic.  You can get the list for your
current environment with this one-liner:

 perl -MFFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32 -E "say for sort keys %{ FFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32->native_type_map }"

This plugin will also set the correct ABI for use with Win32 API
functions.  (On 32 bit systems a different ABI is used for Win32 API
than what is used by the C library, on 32 bit systems the same ABI
is used).  Most of the time this exactly what you want, but if you
need to use functions that are using the standard C calling convention,
but need the Win32 types, you can do that by setting the ABI back
immediately after loading the language plugin:

 $ffi->lang('Win32');
 $ffi->abi('default_abi');

Most of the types should be pretty self-explanatory or at least provided
in the Microsoft documentation on the internet, but the use of Unicode
strings probably requires some more detail:

[version 1.35]

This plugin also provides C<LPCWSTR> and C<LPWSTR> "wide" string types
which are implemented using L<FFI::Platypus::Type::WideString>.  For
full details, please see the documentation for that module, and note
that C<LPCWSTR> is a wide string in the read-only string mode and
C<LPWSTR> is a wide string in the read-write buffer mode.

The C<LPCWSTR> is handled fairly transparently by the plugin, but for
when using read-write buffers (C<LPWSTR>) with the Win32 API you typically
need to allocate a buffer string of the right size.  These examples will
use C<GetCurrentDirectoryW> attached as C<GetCurrentDirectory>
as in the synopsis above.  These are illustrative only, you would normally
want to use the L<Cwd> module to get the current working directory.

=item default buffer size 2048

The simplest way is to fallback on the rather arbitrary default buffer size of 2048.

 my $dir;
 GetCurrentDirectory(1024, \$dir);
 print "I am in the directory: $dir\n";

B<Discussion>: This only works if you know the API that you are using will not ever use
more than 2048 bytes.  The author believes this to be the case for C<GetCurrentDirectoryW>
since directory paths in windows have a maximum of 260 characters.  If every character was
outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) they would take up exactly 4 characters each.
(This is probably not ever the case since the disk volume at least will be a Latin letter).
Taking account of the C<NULL> termination you would need 260 * 4 + 2 bytes or 1048 bytes.

We pass in a reference to our scalar so that the Win32 API can write into it.

We are passing in half the number of bytes as the first argument because the API expects
the number of C<WCHAR> (or C<wchar_t>), not the number of bytes or the technically the
number of characters since characters can take up either 2 or 4 bytes in UTF-16.

=item allocate your buffer to your own size.

If possible it is of course always best to allocate exactly the size of buffer that
you need.

 my $size = GetCurrentDirectory(0, undef);
 my $dir = "\0\0" x $size;
 GetCurrentDirectory($size, \$dir);
 print "I am in the directory: $dir\n";

B<Discussion>: In this case the API provides a way of getting the exact size of buffer
that you need.  We allocate this in Perl by creating a string of C<NULLs> of the right
length.  The Perl string C<"\0"> is exactly on byte, so we double that before using the
C<x> operator to multiple that by the size returned by the API.

Now, somewhat unexpectedly what is returned is not the same buffer, but a new string
in new UTF-8 encoded Perl string.  This is what you want most of the time.

=item initialize your read-write buffer

Some APIs might be modifying an existing string rather than just writing an entirely
new one.  In  that case you still want to allocate a buffer, but you want to initialize
it with a value.  You can do this by passing an array reference instead of a scalar
reference.  The firs element of the array is the buffer, and the second is the initialization.

 my $dir;
 GetCurrentDirectory($size, [ \$dir, "I ❤ Perl + Platypus" ]);

B<Discussion>: Note that this particular API ignores the string passed in and writes
over it, but this demonstrates how you would initialize a buffer string.  Once again,
if C<$dir> is not initialized (is C<undef>), then a buffer of the default size of 2048
bytes will be created internally.  You can also allocate a specific number of bytes
as in the previous example.

=item allocate memory using C<malloc> etc.

You can also allocate memory using C<malloc> (see L<FFI::Platypus::Memory>) and encode
your string using L<Encode> and copy it using C<wcscpy>.  This may be appropriate in
some cases, but it is beyond the scope of this document.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 abi

 my $abi = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32->abi;

This is called internally when the type plugin is loaded by Platypus.
It selects the appropriate ABI to make Win32 API function calls.

=cut

sub abi
{
  $^O =~ /^(cygwin|MSWin32|msys)$/ && $Config{ptrsize} == 4
  ? 'stdcall'
  : 'default_abi';
}

=head2 native_type_map

 my $hashref = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32->native_type_map;

This is called internally when the type plugin is loaded by Platypus.
It provides types aliases useful on the Windows platform, so it may
also be useful for introspection.

This returns a hash reference containing the native aliases for the
Windows API.  That is the keys are native Windows API C types and the
values are libffi native types.

This will includes types like C<DWORD> and C<HWND>, and others.  The
full list may be adjusted over time and may be computed dynamically.
To get the full list for your install you can use this one-liner:

 perl -MFFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32 -E "say for sort keys %{ FFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32->native_type_map }"

This is called internally when the type plugin is loaded by Platypus.
It provides custom types useful on the Windows platform.  For now
that means the C<LPWSTR> and C<LPCWSTR> types.

=head1 CAVEATS

The Win32 API isn't a different computer language in the same sense that the
other language plugins (those for Fortran or Rust for example).  But implementing
these types as a language plugin is the most convenient way to do it.

Prior to version 1.35, this plugin didn't provide an implementation for
C<LPWSTR> or C<LPCWSTR>, so in the likely event that you need those types make
sure you also require at least that version of Platypus.
